## Hi there, I'm Purva Suresh ğŸ‘‹

<!--
I'm a Computer Science student at the University of North Texas with a strong passion for cybersecurity. I enjoy tackling security challenges, from secure coding to cryptography and threat analysis, and I'm always looking for ways to strengthen digital defenses.

Integrity and protecting both organizations and individuals are important to me. I believe security isnâ€™t just about technologyâ€”itâ€™s also about ensuring trust and compliance. My problem-solving skills and ability to break down complex security concepts help me contribute to stronger, safer systems.

As I work toward certifications like CompTIA Network+ and Security+, Iâ€™m eager to apply my skills in a real-world setting. I'm currently looking for an entry-level Cyber Security Analyst role where I can grow, learn, and make an impact in the field.
